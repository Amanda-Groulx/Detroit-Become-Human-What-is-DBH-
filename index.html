    <p>Detroit becomes human is a multiple choice game where you can control the lives of three characters where you become attached and learn more about their stories.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The main story of the game takes place in 2038 where there are human-like androids and they were programmed to follow orders by humans. Not all androids follow orders though, some can become deviant because of an emotional shock or “awakening”. Throughout the game, you can choose from the three androids you play as to become deviant, or remain a machine and follow orders.</p>
    <br>
    <p>This game has multiple endings that you can choose from, but the most common is the “good ending” and the “bad ending”. In order to achieve a good ending, your job while playing is to make sure all the characters live and become deviant, which i'll explain more when going into detail about the characters. For the bad ending, you either have to kill all of the characters or make them not become deviant.</p>
